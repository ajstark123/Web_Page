                    First you sit (in meditation), and develop your <a href="glossary.html#samādhi">Samadhi</a>. In <a href="glossary.html#samādhi">Samadhi</a> the limited self-centered consciousness disappears. Then you recognize that you and the universe are one. It just happens automatically.

                    We let the body calm down first, then we let the mind calm down. And in order to accomplish this, we use techniques such as breathing. We concentrate on breathing by counting breaths or following breaths. After we have settled, we enter <a href="glossary.html#samādhi">Samadhi</a>, we focus on one single thing and become one with it. So if your practice is Mu, become one with Mu. If you are counting the breath, become one with the counting. If you do shikantaza, become zazen yourself. By doing this, you enter <a href="glossary.html#samādhi">Samadhi</a>. Then, when you really get immersed in <a href="glossary.html#samādhi">Samadhi</a>, eventually you forget yourself, and dichotomy is transcended.

                    When we sit, two major types of hindrances may occur: a scattered, busy mind, and a dull, drowsy mind. And the way to eliminate both these hindrances while we sit is to concentrate in zazen as though engaged in the fight for our very lives.

                    The point of our practice is not to become something other than what we already are, such as a buddha or enlightened person, but to realize or become aware of the fact that we are intrinsically, originally, the Way itself, free and complete.

                    The experience attained by zazen practice is not a thought or a philosophy or a religion, but merely a fact, a happening. And strange as it may seem, the experience of that fact has the power to free us from the agonies of the pains of the world. It emancipates us from the anxiety of all worldly suffering. No one knows why that experience has such wonderful power, but it does. This is the most important point, and it’s the most difficult to try to explain.

                <p class="nomargin">
                    In the Zen experience, a certain unity happens; subject and object become one and we come to realize our own self-nature. This self-nature cannot be seen, it cannot be touched, it cannot be heard. Because of these characteristics, we refer to it as empty (in Japanese, ku), but its activities are infinite. So, we say the Zen experience is the realization of the empty-infinite of our self-nature or our essential-nature, as it is often called.

                <p class="nomargin">
                    When this happens, it is accompanied by a great peace of mind. At that moment we feel as though the heavy burdens we have been carrying in our head or on our shoulders, indeed all over our body and soul, suddenly disappear as if thrown away. The joy and happiness at that time is beyond all words; and there are no philosophies or theologies attached to it.

                    Our most profound life problem, the problem of life-and-death, cannot be solved fundamentally by concentration. It can only be resolved by enlightenment and the personalization  of that experience. So if we want to free ourselves from the anxiety of the sufferings of life through zazen, the <a href="glossary.html#satori">Satori</a> experience should be our main purpose for practicing zazen.

                    To attain this experience of enlightenment is not very difficult. For some people, only one sesshin is necessary. But to accomplish our ultimate personality is very difficult indeed, and requires an extremely long period of time.
