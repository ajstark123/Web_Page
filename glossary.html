                    <b>Kensho</b>, Japanese; Zen expression for the experience of awakening (enlightenment). Since the meaning is “seeing one’s own true nature.” Kenso is usually translated as “self-realization.” Like all words that try to reduce the conceptually ungraspable experience of enlightenment to a concept, this one is also not entirely accurate and is even misleading, since the experience contains no duality of “seer” and “seen” because there is no “nature of self” as an object that is seen by a subject separate from it.
                </p>
                <p class="nomargin">
                    Semantically Kensho has the same meaning as satori and the two terms are often used as synonymously. Nevertheless, it is customary to use the word satori when speaking of the enlightenment of the Buddha or the Zen patriarchs and to use the word Kensho when speaking of an initial enlightenment experience that still requires to be deepened.

                    <b>Sūnyatā</b>. (T. stong pa nyid; C. kong; J. kū; K. kong 空). In Sanskrit, “emptiness”; the term has a number of denotations, but is most commonly associated with the perfection of wisdom (PRAJÑĀPĀRAMITĀ) sūtras and the MADHYAMAKA school of Mahāyāna philosophy. Emptiness is the lack or absence of intrinsic nature (SVABHĀVA) in any and all phenomena, the final nature of all things (DHARMATĀ), and the ultimate truth (PARAMĀRTHASATYA). Emptiness is clearly neither nothingness nor the absence of existence, but rather the absence of a falsely imagined type of existence, identified as svabhāva. Because all phenomena are dependently arisen, they lack, or are empty of, an intrinsic nature characterized by independence and autonomy.

                    <b>Tathatā</b>, (T. de bzhin nyid/ de kho na nyid; C. zhenru; J. shinnyo; K. chinyŏ 眞 如). In Sanskrit, “suchness” or “thusness”; a term for ultimate reality, especially in the MAHĀYĀNA schools. Along with terms such as DHARMATĀ, DHARMADHĀTU, and BHŪTAKOṬI, it has a more “positive” connotation than emptiness (ŚŪNYATĀ), referring to the eternal nature of reality that is “ever thus” or “just so” and free of all conceptual elaborations. In YOGĀCĀRA/ VIJÑĀNAVĀDA, the term refers to the ultimate wisdom that is free from the subject– object distinction (GRĀHYAGRĀHAKAVIKALPA). Buddhahood is sometimes described as tathatāviśuddhi, or “purity of suchness,” that is, ultimate reality purified of all obstructions. In the MADHYAMAKA school, any attempt to substantiate the nature of reality is rejected, and tathatā is instead identified with emptiness and the cessation of all dichotomizing tendencies of thought.
